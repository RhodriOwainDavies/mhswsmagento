============

The MHSWS Magento Connector is sample code provided by MHS but not supported by MHS (at this time). It is in its early beta availability. It is built on top of MHSWS High Level API which is built on top of MHSWS Basic API https://github.com/babakm/mhswsstackapi-gen2rms.

The MHSWS High Level API is in production, and so is the MHSWS Basic API https://github.com/babakm/mhswsstackapi-gen2rms. We are experimenting with the Magento specific code during early beta, and will be supporting a "Magento extension" in the near future. Having said that, the Magento extension may support only so many uses cases, and in order keep the environment as flexible as possible, we have decided to make the base Magento connector code here availale "as is." In almost all cases (at least "currently"), our Magento customers have Magento expertise, and that is the reason they prefer flexibility here.
